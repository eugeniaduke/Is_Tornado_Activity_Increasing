# Tornado Analysis Capstone Project

## Description

This project explores the tornado trends over the last 10 years. It demonstrates data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization in Python.  

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python packages:  
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open `Capstone.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

## Usage 

## Data Sources

    NOAA - https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/stormevents/choosedates.jsp?statefips=21%2CKENTUCKY
        -   Tornado Tracks CSV file (provided in `datasets/`)
    
        
- Weather Detail CSV file (provided in `datasets/`)

## Project Structure

## Results
The analysis shows trends in tornado occurrences geographical distribution. Initially the data was visualized using static maps, but an interactive heatmap was later implemented for better insights.  While the bar graph used showed an increase in tornado occurrences, the heatmap provided a clearer geographical distribution.  The analysis is inclusive at this time because it's unknown if the increase in tornado activity is due to better tracking or an actual increase in occurrences.
