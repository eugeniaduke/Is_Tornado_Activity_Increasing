Part of the NWS security fence was knocked down, and some large limbs were knocked down off the Smyrna Road exit towards McNeely Lake Park. Several trees fell down in the Hillview area near the Bullitt County line. All of the trees were facing from the west southwest to the east northeasterly direction.||The tornado initially touched down just east of Beulah Church Rd, near Adams Run Road which is just south of I-265. Trees were facing from the northeast through the southeast primarily in a 100 yard swath with a lot of straight line winds surrounding the 80 mph twister. Two barns sustained roof panel damage.||The tornado became very intermittent along Cedar Creek Road to Gentry Lane with tops of pine and cedar trees sheared off and with shingle and sporadic roof damage on some homes. Winds were 75 to 80 mph in this area.||The tornado increased to EF1 in the Glenmary Reserves subdivision. The tornado drone video showing a distinct swirl in the trees from the north through the southeasterly directions. Trees were snapped, uprooted, and laying on top of power lines. Winds were around 90 mph in this area, with a width of 150 yards. There was extensive shingle damage, gutter damage, flashing, at several homes. The tornado increased in width to 175 yards and speed along Providence Road. There was more extensive damage to the roofing structures of several homes. One house in particular had wind enter its roof soffit, blowing building material out the western side. The house insulation was thrown around three sides of the home. Wind speeds in this area were estimated to be 97 mph with a width of 125 yards. A Ford Ranger, parked in another driveway was picked up and slid 11 yards, with house insulation on three sides of the truck.||There were several road signs twisted and mangled too. The tornado continued towards the entrance of the Glenmary Reserves subdivision off Bardstown Road. There was extensive tree damage, especially cedars and pines, facing from the north-northeast, through the southeasterly direction. Trees were uprooted, snapped, and slightly sheared off. The 88-D radar showed a distinct debris ball in the area we found the tornado.||The tornado crossed Bardstown Road striking at least two vehicles, thankfully there were no injuries. The tornado continued in the Glenmary subdivision with numerous homes having shingle and roof damamge along with plenty of trees down. One home in particular had the 85-90 mph wind get in through the attached garage. This caused a massive structural failure in the roofing structure, with roof decking and insulation thrown up into the trees from a northerly to a southeasterly direction. Insulation was thrown around three sides of the house.||The owner of the house described intense ear pressure when the tornado went over his house.The tornado weakened by the far eastern part of the Glenmary subdivision lifted at that point. There was still one and two story home damage. Most of the damage to the homes was related to shingle, flashing, and siding. Winds were generally around 80 mph. Wind speeds, along the sporadic tree damage, at the end point were 75 mph by Hidden Valley Way with a width of 100 yards.||South Louisville (Big Run Creek to Turkey Run Park)...||Very sporadic tree damage was found with drones and binoculars around the park. Park Rangers took us through the park and it was very hard to find more than isolated damage points here and there. Winds were EFO with winds in the 75-80 mph range.||The tornado really became more distinct on the eastern entrance of Turkey Run Park and especially along Echo Trail Road. At 7401 Echo Trail numerous trees were topped, sheared off, and twisted, and facing from north northeast to east southeast. Winds were 80 to 85 mph in this area. Shingle and gutter damage was noted along Echo Trail and then it headed into the hilly rugged area of Echo Trail Rd and Hickory Valley Road. Larger hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted, an outbuilding lost its roof and 2 deer stands were destroyed. Wind in this area were 90 mph EF1 with a width of 75 yards.

Across southern Indiana and central Kentucky, temperatures surged into the upper 70s and lower 80s during the afternoon hours before the front's arrival, although dewpoints in the mid-to-upper 50s limited overall surface-based instability. In spite of modest dewpoints, between 500-1000 J/kg MUCAPE was able to develop ahead of developing storms, and effective bulk shear of 40-45 kts provided ample dynamic support to sustain convection across the area. The majority of the severe reports on this day was associated with initially discrete cells which quickly grew upscale into multicell clusters along and just north of the Ohio River. The cells developed in an area with 7-7.5 degree Celsius per kilometer mid-level lapse rates and 300-500 J/kg CAPE in the -10 to -30 Celsius layer, which indicates an environment at least marginally favorable for hail.

On the synoptic scale, a shortwave upper-level trough located over the mid-Mississippi Valley became negatively tilted during the morning hours of March 3rd. A 120 knot 500 mb jet developed across central Kentucky and middle Tennessee in the presence of a very strong height gradient. The footprint of this jet core was transferred into the lower levels of the atmosphere, with a 70 knot jet at 850 mb present across the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys. The orientation of the shortwave trough aloft with respect to the low level cyclone was nearly ideal for mutual amplification, with both the surface low and the upper trough undergoing deepening during the morning and early afternoon hours on March 3rd. Ultimately, the surface low's minimum central pressure dropped to approximately 976 millibars near Vincennes, Indiana by mid-afternoon on the 3rd, creating an anomalously strong low-level pressure and height gradient across central Kentucky and southern Indiana.||Before the severe weather and strong gradient winds began, the first impact from this strong mid-latitude cyclone would come in the form of heavy rainfall, primarily across southern Indiana. With the strong low-level jet helping to advect warm and moist air northward, precipitable water values were anomalously high, ranging from 1.3 to 1.6 inches across southern Indiana and central Kentucky during the morning hours on March 3rd. Coupled with an intensifying low level warm frontal boundary which provided a large-scale lifting mechanism, this axis of high moisture content contributed to a broad swath of precipitation, which lasted through much of the morning and early afternoon hours across southern Indiana. Ultimately, many locations would receive between 3 and 6 inches of rain over the span of about 12 hours, causing isolated to scattered reports of flooding.||After the initial wave of precipitation associated with the warm front lifted into central Indiana, southern Indiana and central Kentucky would briefly be located in the warm sector of the cyclone during the late morning and early afternoon hours, providing an opportunity for severe weather. Due to the proximity of the surface low and the relatively limited period for destabilization, instability was very limited for this event, with between 250-750 J/kg MLCAPE present across central Kentucky and southern Indiana. However, with the extremely strong dynamics in place, wind shear parameters were incredibly high. Effective bulk shear generally ranged from 70-100 kt, while effective Storm Relative Helicity ranged from 300-600 m2/s2. In addition, low-level Storm Relative Helicity was maximized (300-400 m2/s2) just ahead of a broken line of low-topped supercells which went on to produce three EF-1 tornadoes across southern Indiana. Across central Kentucky, the main severe impacts would come from damaging straight-line winds within a broken quasi-linear convective system. While limited instability clearly reduced the overall strength of the QLCS, some convective cores were deep enough to pull higher momentum air from aloft down to the surface, causing scattered damage and wind gusts above 58 mph. A few additional severe wind gusts would also be produced by the aforementioned line of low-topped supercells as they moved across southern Indiana and northern Kentucky.||While the heavy rainfall and severe weather were important aspects of this system, the most widespread impacts from this historic system would come from extremely strong gradient winds immediately following the passage of showers and storms along the surface cold front. As was previously mentioned, the rapid cyclogenesis as the surface low moved into western Kentucky and southwestern Indiana created an unusually strong pressure gradient across the region, even for cool season mid-latitude cyclones. This strong pressure gradient, combined with a brief period of steeper low-level lapse rates across central Kentucky thanks to temporary clearing in the wake of the cold front, helped to bring extremely strong winds and wind gusts to all of central Kentucky and most of southern Indiana. Widespread sustained winds of 30-40 mph and wind gusts of 60-80 mph were observed across the area, causing widespread tree and power line damage, as well as more scattered occurrences of structural damage. At one point, around half a million customers were without power across the state of Kentucky, with several counties seeing a temporary near-total loss in electrical service. As the mid-level cyclone moved overhead during the early evening hours, cloud cover would return, helping to reduce wind speeds and gusts somewhat, with conditions continuing to calm through the overnight hours into the morning of March 4th.",69

The synoptic pattern was fairly consistent (albeit active) during this period, with large-scale mid- and upper-level troughing extending from Hudson Bay down into the Ohio Valley. In the low-levels, a quasi-stationary front extended from the mid-Mississippi Valley across central Indiana and into northern Ohio, with a seasonably warm and unstable air mass present across the Ohio Valley, which was primarily located south of the low-level frontal boundary. The first wave of strong to severe storms developed during the late afternoon hours in the vicinity of the frontal boundary across central Indiana. As these cells morphed into a quasi-linear convective system during the evening hours, the combined cold pool development forced the storms southward into southern Indiana and central Kentucky. Ahead of the line of storms, mixed-layer CAPE on the order of 1500-2500 J/kg and effective bulk shear of 30-40 kt provided a favorable parameter space to sustain strong-to-severe convection. This line of storms ultimately produced sporadic wind damage and near-severe hail across southern Indiana and north central Kentucky, with convection lingering into south central Kentucky overnight before gradually dissipating in the early morning hours on July 18th.||While sporadic convection continued through the morning hours on July 18th, the next main wave of strong and occasionally severe thunderstorms arrived during the early afternoon hours. With unseasonably fast flow continuing aloft, wind shear remained sufficient for multicell clusters and a few supercells to develop across central Kentucky. Instability remained moderate to high, with low-to-mid 70s dewpoints and temperatures in the 80s allowing for the development of 2000-3000 J/kg MLCAPE. This initial wave of cells produced scattered wind damage and hail mainly across the Kentucky Bluegrass. Additionally, a decaying mesoscale convective system coming in from western Kentucky also produced scattered wind damage across southern and central Kentucky.

Two quick spin up tornadoes in Clinton County were also associated with this line.||After a second sub-severe line of storms moved across the area during the early afternoon hours, conditions were relatively quiet until the mid-to-late afternoon, when strong and severe cells began to develop across western Kentucky and southern Illinois. The storms would initially be discrete before growing into another large line of storms which produced the heaviest damage south of Interstate 64. Six tornadoes would be associated with this second line, with a long track EF1 tornado extending for over 40 miles across Muhlenberg, Butler, and Warren County. Heavy straight-line wind damage was also observed with this second line of storms, especially in Barren, Mercer, and Garrard County. The line of storms finally pushed east of the area shortly after midnight on May 27th, bringing an end to an active 16 hours across central Kentucky.",164

It was on the ground for just under 10 miles and lasted 10 minutes. Its widest point is estimated at 350 yards and peak winds of 145 mph, or an EF3 tornado.||A few trees were uprooted as the tornado first touched down near Rivanna Dr. and Watterson Trail. It was mostly elevated as it continued to near the Jeffersontown municipal building, where it peeled back roofing on a metal warehouse and topped a few trees and one uprooted tree. The tornado moved east northeast peeling back the roof of a tall metal warehouse building just off Electron Dr. ||The tornado intensified along Ampere Court and Ampere Drive. The northeast side of a brick institutional building was completely blown out. Trees were uprooted and insulation was thrown in multiple directions. A large metal building had a failure of |X-braces in the lateral load resisting system. Metal pieces and insulation were thrown into trees and road signs. Immediately next-door, at KEP electric there was a complete destruction of another building, which had a brick bottom half and a metal top |half, and the metal and insulation was thrown in every direction, some of which traveled close to a mile. This was the strongest part of the tornado, and it only maintained this strength briefly. Tornado wind speeds were between 140 and 145 mph, EF3, with a width of 200 yards in this area. Some very subtle terrain is noted on topographic maps just west southwest of this area as well as a relative clearing of buildings, and these factors may briefly have influenced the strength of the tornado. ||A concrete warehouse building along Technology Drive had the walls blown down and roofing material lifted up and twisted in many directions. There was a collapse of pre-cast concrete tilt-up panels. There were several collapsed light poles as well. This |was the widest part of the tornado, an estimated 350 yards. At J & J, Transportation on Plantside Drive, a metal warehouse, had a failure of X-braces in the lateral load resisting system. Debris from the building was thrown at least a half a mile. At the Chick-fil-A across the street, bricks were peeled off the building, a large amount of roofing material was twisted and lifted. At 11900 Plantside Dr. (next door to Chick-fil-A) the metal roof of a brick building was peeled and thrown, and an extremely large air |conditioning unit was thrown off the roof to a distance of 75 yards, weighing several hundred pounds. Farther east on Plantside Drive behind the Interstate Battery building, at Creation Kingdom, a large section of the metal building was opened up, and metal support beams were twisted and bent. At Warren Technology at Campus Place, two brick walls were knocked out. The metal roof was peeled off, windows blown out, trees were uprooted, and many vehicles were moved and windows all blown out. Papa Johns |headquarters building had some windows blown out, and some HVAC units damaged on the roof, but overall the building fared very well. ||On Pope Lick Road, trees were twisted and topped, power poles were snapped. At Interstate 64 at English Station Road, signs were twisted and damaged and numerous trees were topped, twisted, and uprooted. The Stables Apartments had roof damage, |windows blown out, and car windows blown out. At Beckley Hills Drive at Beckley Hills Road, there were multiple homes with siding off, shingles off, blue tarps on roofs, gutter damage, and many missing shingles. There were several areas in Floyd s Fork Park |that had trees topped and uprooted. The last damage point was off of Flat Rock Road at 1710 Pope Dale Rd, where there were a few top trees and a couple of uprooted trees in a forested area.","On the night of April 2nd, 2025, a cold front approached the lower Ohio Valley.

An unusually deep closed upper low slowly moved across the upper Midwest on the 16th, with strong mid- and upper-level southwest flow overspreading the Mississippi and Ohio Valley. The upper low pressure system brought a surface cold front into the Mississippi Valley by the morning of May 16th, with the front stalling out over the region until clearing to the east by the morning hours of May 17th. Ahead of the cold front, a typically unstable late spring air mass was present, with temperatures in the 80s and dewpoint temperatures in the upper 60s and lower 70s. The combination of strong wind shear for mid-May and a moist, unstable environment set the stage for severe weather across central Kentucky and southern Indiana.||During the early morning hours on May 16th, discrete cells, some supercellular, began to develop along the Ohio River and across central Kentucky. These cells were assisted by a 35 knot southwesterly low-level jet, which provided enough instability via low-level moisture transport for convection to initiate. Most of the morning convection was elevated, with between 2000-3000 J/kg of most unstable parcel CAPE present above a relatively stable boundary layer. Given the strong flow aloft, effective bulk shear was strong, around 55-60 kt, supporting organized multicell and supercell clusters. For the first wave of storms which moved across central Kentucky during the morning hours, large hail was the primary severe threat, with several reports of quarter to ping pong ball sized hail reported in severe storms.

By the late evening hours, supercells across western Kentucky and southern Illinois merged into a squall line as it moved over central Kentucky, producing larger swaths of wind damage with several reports of over 60 mph winds.

The first wave of storms continued until around midday, with a lull in activity occurring through the late afternoon hours.||During the early and mid-afternoon hours, breaks in cloud cover allowed for additional destabilization to occur, with temperatures warming into the low 80s and dewpoint temperatures in the low 70s ahead of the second wave of severe storms. This would support between 3500-4500 J/kg of surface-based CAPE across central Kentucky and extending into southern Indiana, setting up quite an unstable environment. Wind shear values were also extremely high ahead of the second wave of storms, with 60-70 knots of effective bulk shear noted in mesoanalysis data. Strong low-level wind shear and helicity were also present, with the parameter space supporting significant threats from damaging winds, hail, and tornadoes. The second wave of storms began as a broken line of supercells across Missouri, which moved into western and central Kentucky during the early evening hours. A dominant lead supercell moved across south central Kentucky, producing significant wind damage and up to baseball sized hail as it tracked from Logan and Butler County across to Russell County. As the supercell moved across Russell County, rotation aloft within the cell translated to the ground, with the storm producing a strong tornado which produced up to EF3 damage in eastern Russell County before tracking for nearly 60 miles across southeastern Kentucky, with maximum damage of EF4 strength near London. Additional supercells farther to the north also produced isolated wind damage and hail. By the late evening hours, supercells across western Kentucky and southern Illinois merged into a squall line as it moved over central Kentucky, producing larger swaths of wind damage with several reports of over 60 mph winds. A spin-up tornado was also observed with this line over Logan County, producing EF1 damage. The line of severe storms finally pushed into eastern Kentucky during the early morning hours on May 17th, bringing an end to the severe weather threat.",255

An unusually deep closed upper low slowly moved across the upper Midwest on the 16th, with strong mid- and upper-level southwest flow overspreading the Mississippi and Ohio Valley. The upper low pressure system brought a surface cold front into the Mississippi Valley by the morning of May 16th, with the front stalling out over the region until clearing to the east by the morning hours of May 17th. Ahead of the cold front, a typically unstable late spring air mass was present, with temperatures in the 80s and dewpoint temperatures in the upper 60s and lower 70s. The combination of strong wind shear for mid-May and a moist, unstable environment set the stage for severe weather across central Kentucky and southern Indiana.||During the early morning hours on May 16th, discrete cells, some supercellular, began to develop along the Ohio River and across central Kentucky. These cells were assisted by a 35 knot southwesterly low-level jet, which provided enough instability via low-level moisture transport for convection to initiate. Most of the morning convection was elevated, with between 2000-3000 J/kg of most unstable parcel CAPE present above a relatively stable boundary layer. Given the strong flow aloft, effective bulk shear was strong, around 55-60 kt, supporting organized multicell and supercell clusters.
