The initial wave of storms along a warm front moved across north central Kentucky and southern Indiana during the pre-dawn hours, bringing generally sub-severe hail with isolated quarter-sized hail reports. Storms along this boundary were not surface based, but were able to utilize 500-1000 J/kg MUCAPE via steep mid-level lapse rates to produce convection which was of sufficient depth and strength to produce hailstones. Wind shear was more than sufficient for sustaining convection throughout the event, with anywhere from 50-60 kt effective bulk shear across central Kentucky.

Across southern Indiana and central Kentucky, temperatures surged into the upper 70s and lower 80s during the afternoon hours before the front's arrival, although dewpoints in the mid-to-upper 50s limited overall surface-based instability. In spite of modest dewpoints, between 500-1000 J/kg MUCAPE was able to develop ahead of developing storms, and effective bulk shear of 40-45 kts provided ample dynamic support to sustain convection across the area. The majority of the severe reports on this day was associated with initially discrete cells which quickly grew upscale into multicell clusters along and just north of the Ohio River. The cells developed in an area with 7-7.5 degree Celsius per kilometer mid-level lapse rates and 300-500 J/kg CAPE in the -10 to -30 Celsius layer, which indicates an environment at least marginally favorable for hail.

On the synoptic scale, a shortwave upper-level trough located over the mid-Mississippi Valley became negatively tilted during the morning hours of March 3rd. A 120 knot 500 mb jet developed across central Kentucky and middle Tennessee in the presence of a very strong height gradient. The footprint of this jet core was transferred into the lower levels of the atmosphere, with a 70 knot jet at 850 mb present across the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys. The orientation of the shortwave trough aloft with respect to the low level cyclone was nearly ideal for mutual amplification, with both the surface low and the upper trough undergoing deepening during the morning and early afternoon hours on March 3rd. Ultimately, the surface low's minimum central pressure dropped to approximately 976 millibars near Vincennes, Indiana by mid-afternoon on the 3rd, creating an anomalously strong low-level pressure and height gradient across central Kentucky and southern Indiana.||Before the severe weather and strong gradient winds began, the first impact from this strong mid-latitude cyclone would come in the form of heavy rainfall, primarily across southern Indiana. With the strong low-level jet helping to advect warm and moist air northward, precipitable water values were anomalously high, ranging from 1.3 to 1.6 inches across southern Indiana and central Kentucky during the morning hours on March 3rd. Coupled with an intensifying low level warm frontal boundary which provided a large-scale lifting mechanism, this axis of high moisture content contributed to a broad swath of precipitation, which lasted through much of the morning and early afternoon hours across southern Indiana. Ultimately, many locations would receive between 3 and 6 inches of rain over the span of about 12 hours, causing isolated to scattered reports of flooding.||After the initial wave of precipitation associated with the warm front lifted into central Indiana, southern Indiana and central Kentucky would briefly be located in the warm sector of the cyclone during the late morning and early afternoon hours, providing an opportunity for severe weather. Due to the proximity of the surface low and the relatively limited period for destabilization, instability was very limited for this event, with between 250-750 J/kg MLCAPE present across central Kentucky and southern Indiana. However, with the extremely strong dynamics in place, wind shear parameters were incredibly high. Effective bulk shear generally ranged from 70-100 kt, while effective Storm Relative Helicity ranged from 300-600 m2/s2. In addition, low-level Storm Relative Helicity was maximized (300-400 m2/s2) just ahead of a broken line of low-topped supercells which went on to produce three EF-1 tornadoes across southern Indiana. Across central Kentucky, the main severe impacts would come from damaging straight-line winds within a broken quasi-linear convective system. While limited instability clearly reduced the overall strength of the QLCS, some convective cores were deep enough to pull higher momentum air from aloft down to the surface, causing scattered damage and wind gusts above 58 mph. A few additional severe wind gusts would also be produced by the aforementioned line of low-topped supercells as they moved across southern Indiana and northern Kentucky.||While the heavy rainfall and severe weather were important aspects of this system, the most widespread impacts from this historic system would come from extremely strong gradient winds immediately following the passage of showers and storms along the surface cold front. As was previously mentioned, the rapid cyclogenesis as the surface low moved into western Kentucky and southwestern Indiana created an unusually strong pressure gradient across the region, even for cool season mid-latitude cyclones. This strong pressure gradient, combined with a brief period of steeper low-level lapse rates across central Kentucky thanks to temporary clearing in the wake of the cold front, helped to bring extremely strong winds and wind gusts to all of central Kentucky and most of southern Indiana. Widespread sustained winds of 30-40 mph and wind gusts of 60-80 mph were observed across the area, causing widespread tree and power line damage, as well as more scattered occurrences of structural damage. At one point, around half a million customers were without power across the state of Kentucky, with several counties seeing a temporary near-total loss in electrical service. As the mid-level cyclone moved overhead during the early evening hours, cloud cover would return, helping to reduce wind speeds and gusts somewhat, with conditions continuing to calm through the overnight hours into the morning of March 4th.",40031

In the warm sector, mixed-layer CAPE of 2500-3500 J/kg provided plenty of fuel for convective development aside from the aforementioned favorable jet forcing. With 25-35 knots of flow at 850 mb, there was also ample vertical wind shear across the region, with effective bulk shear values generally above 45 kt, leading to the development of supercellular structures. The parameter space was favorable for all severe hazards. 0-1 km storm-relative helicity was over 200 m2/s2 and significant tornado parameter values were frequently greater than 1, suggesting the potential for rotating mesocyclones and tornadoes. Downdraft CAPE was over 1200 J/kg along and west of Interstate 65, suggesting the potential for strong winds from any formidable downdrafts.

In the low-levels, a quasi-stationary front extended from the mid-Mississippi Valley across central Indiana and into northern Ohio, with a seasonably warm and unstable air mass present across the Ohio Valley, which was primarily located south of the low-level frontal boundary. The first wave of strong to severe storms developed during the late afternoon hours in the vicinity of the frontal boundary across central Indiana. As these cells morphed into a quasi-linear convective system during the evening hours, the combined cold pool development forced the storms southward into southern Indiana and central Kentucky. Ahead of the line of storms, mixed-layer CAPE on the order of 1500-2500 J/kg and effective bulk shear of 30-40 kt provided a favorable parameter space to sustain strong-to-severe convection. This line of storms ultimately produced sporadic wind damage and near-severe hail across southern Indiana and north central Kentucky, with convection lingering into south central Kentucky overnight before gradually dissipating in the early morning hours on July 18th.||While sporadic convection continued through the morning hours on July 18th, the next main wave of strong and occasionally severe thunderstorms arrived during the early afternoon hours. With unseasonably fast flow continuing aloft, wind shear remained sufficient for multicell clusters and a few supercells to develop across central Kentucky. Instability remained moderate to high, with low-to-mid 70s dewpoints and temperatures in the 80s allowing for the development of 2000-3000 J/kg MLCAPE. This initial wave of cells produced scattered wind damage and hail mainly across the Kentucky Bluegrass. Additionally, a decaying mesoscale convective system coming in from western Kentucky also produced scattered wind damage across southern and central Kentucky. One brief spin-up tornado developed within this line over Marion County, producing EF0 damage. Convection dissipated once the line of storms cleared the area around sunset. As a result of multiple waves of heavy rainfall moving over the same areas, scattered occurrences of flooding were observed across the area, with the most concentrated area of flooding occurring over eastern Jefferson County and Shelby County, Kentucky.",40245

The tornado had a path length of 5.43 miles and a width of 30 yards. ||Minor tree damage and structural damage was observed just south of the Gene Snyder Freeway off the Stonestreet exit along Bear Camp road and Blevins Gap Road and was determined to be straight line wind damage. The first observable tornado damage was along Mitchell Hill Road and Keys Ferry Road near Fairdale Elementary School. Large branches were snapped and twisted in varying directions within the tree, as well as trees snapped with a rolled shed nearby. Some of the most notable damage occurred near a few homes along Mitchell Hill Road, where several trees were twisted, uprooted, and snapped. Winds in this location were determined to have been between 85 and 100 mph. An injury was reported to have happened to a resident in this vicinity, where a man was trying to hold a door closed when the wind was strong and hurt his arm.||The tornado continued across Mitchell Hill Road across neighborhoods where several properties observed tree damage and fence damage. The most notable damage was to a garage that was moved off a foundation with estimated wind speeds of 97 mph. The |tornado continued across Mount Holly Road and did damage near a church. A garage lost roofing material and it was lofted into nearby trees. Pockets of tree damage occurred along Wilson Creek and continued near Holly Avenue. Damage occurred to a garage barn where much of the building was destroyed and several wood planks |were impaled in the back and front of a nearby residence. ||The tornado continued across the National Turnpike roadway and impacted a brick one story residence, where the tornado hit with such force that the brick was damaged and the windows were broken out of the home. Portions of the roof were lofted well into the |distance, including the garage barn behind the property. Estimated wind speeds of 100 mph occurred at this location. The tornado continued across South Park Road where garage damage was observed and twisted large branches in trees. The tornado continued eastward where several trees and structure damage was observed |along Barricks Road (just south of Hillview Drive) where the tornado continued to produce estimated wind speeds of between 90 and 100 mph.||Across I-65 the tornado worked into an industrial park between Blue Lick Rd and Preston Hwy south of Interchange Dr. There were a few trees damaged with one notable tree that was split with the large branches blown to the west of the tree. There were visible marks on the ground where the branches had landed and dragged |across the ground for about 3 to 4 feet towards the west after hitting the ground. Wind speeds were between 60 and 75 mph in these locations, and no observable damage was seen beyond this point.","On March 30th, a surface low along with the system's cold front dropped southeast from eastern Iowa through southern Indiana and central Kentucky.

It was on the ground for just under 10 miles and lasted 10 minutes. Its widest point is estimated at 350 yards and peak winds of 145 mph, or an EF3 tornado.||A few trees were uprooted as the tornado first touched down near Rivanna Dr. and Watterson Trail. It was mostly elevated as it continued to near the Jeffersontown municipal building, where it peeled back roofing on a metal warehouse and topped a few trees and one uprooted tree. The tornado moved east northeast peeling back the roof of a tall metal warehouse building just off Electron Dr. ||The tornado intensified along Ampere Court and Ampere Drive. The northeast side of a brick institutional building was completely blown out. Trees were uprooted and insulation was thrown in multiple directions. A large metal building had a failure of |X-braces in the lateral load resisting system. Metal pieces and insulation were thrown into trees and road signs. Immediately next-door, at KEP electric there was a complete destruction of another building, which had a brick bottom half and a metal top |half, and the metal and insulation was thrown in every direction, some of which traveled close to a mile. This was the strongest part of the tornado, and it only maintained this strength briefly. Tornado wind speeds were between 140 and 145 mph, EF3, with a width of 200 yards in this area. Some very subtle terrain is noted on topographic maps just west southwest of this area as well as a relative clearing of buildings, and these factors may briefly have influenced the strength of the tornado. ||A concrete warehouse building along Technology Drive had the walls blown down and roofing material lifted up and twisted in many directions. There was a collapse of pre-cast concrete tilt-up panels. There were several collapsed light poles as well. This |was the widest part of the tornado, an estimated 350 yards. At J & J, Transportation on Plantside Drive, a metal warehouse, had a failure of X-braces in the lateral load resisting system. Debris from the building was thrown at least a half a mile. At the Chick-fil-A across the street, bricks were peeled off the building, a large amount of roofing material was twisted and lifted. At 11900 Plantside Dr. (next door to Chick-fil-A) the metal roof of a brick building was peeled and thrown, and an extremely large air |conditioning unit was thrown off the roof to a distance of 75 yards, weighing several hundred pounds. Farther east on Plantside Drive behind the Interstate Battery building, at Creation Kingdom, a large section of the metal building was opened up, and metal support beams were twisted and bent. At Warren Technology at Campus Place, two brick walls were knocked out. The metal roof was peeled off, windows blown out, trees were uprooted, and many vehicles were moved and windows all blown out. Papa Johns |headquarters building had some windows blown out, and some HVAC units damaged on the roof, but overall the building fared very well. ||On Pope Lick Road, trees were twisted and topped, power poles were snapped. At Interstate 64 at English Station Road, signs were twisted and damaged and numerous trees were topped, twisted, and uprooted. The Stables Apartments had roof damage, |windows blown out, and car windows blown out. At Beckley Hills Drive at Beckley Hills Road, there were multiple homes with siding off, shingles off, blue tarps on roofs, gutter damage, and many missing shingles. There were several areas in Floyd s Fork Park |that had trees topped and uprooted. The last damage point was off of Flat Rock Road at 1710 Pope Dale Rd, where there were a few top trees and a couple of uprooted trees in a forested area.","On the night of April 2nd, 2025, a cold front approached the lower Ohio Valley.

An unusually deep closed upper low slowly moved across the upper Midwest on the 16th, with strong mid- and upper-level southwest flow overspreading the Mississippi and Ohio Valley. The upper low pressure system brought a surface cold front into the Mississippi Valley by the morning of May 16th, with the front stalling out over the region until clearing to the east by the morning hours of May 17th. Ahead of the cold front, a typically unstable late spring air mass was present, with temperatures in the 80s and dewpoint temperatures in the upper 60s and lower 70s. The combination of strong wind shear for mid-May and a moist, unstable environment set the stage for severe weather across central Kentucky and southern Indiana.||During the early morning hours on May 16th, discrete cells, some supercellular, began to develop along the Ohio River and across central Kentucky. These cells were assisted by a 35 knot southwesterly low-level jet, which provided enough instability via low-level moisture transport for convection to initiate. Most of the morning convection was elevated, with between 2000-3000 J/kg of most unstable parcel CAPE present above a relatively stable boundary layer. Given the strong flow aloft, effective bulk shear was strong, around 55-60 kt, supporting organized multicell and supercell clusters. For the first wave of storms which moved across central Kentucky during the morning hours, large hail was the primary severe threat, with several reports of quarter to ping pong ball sized hail reported in severe storms. By later in the morning, isolated wind damage was also observed with severe storms across south central Kentucky. The first wave of storms continued until around midday, with a lull in activity occurring through the late afternoon hours.||During the early and mid-afternoon hours, breaks in cloud cover allowed for additional destabilization to occur, with temperatures warming into the low 80s and dewpoint temperatures in the low 70s ahead of the second wave of severe storms. This would support between 3500-4500 J/kg of surface-based CAPE across central Kentucky and extending into southern Indiana, setting up quite an unstable environment. Wind shear values were also extremely high ahead of the second wave of storms, with 60-70 knots of effective bulk shear noted in mesoanalysis data. Strong low-level wind shear and helicity were also present, with the parameter space supporting significant threats from damaging winds, hail, and tornadoes.

As the supercell moved across Russell County, rotation aloft within the cell translated to the ground, with the storm producing a strong tornado which produced up to EF3 damage in eastern Russell County before tracking for nearly 60 miles across southeastern Kentucky, with maximum damage of EF4 strength near London. Additional supercells farther to the north also produced isolated wind damage and hail. By the late evening hours, supercells across western Kentucky and southern Illinois merged into a squall line as it moved over central Kentucky, producing larger swaths of wind damage with several reports of over 60 mph winds.

An unusually deep closed upper low slowly moved across the upper Midwest on the 16th, with strong mid- and upper-level southwest flow overspreading the Mississippi and Ohio Valley. The upper low pressure system brought a surface cold front into the Mississippi Valley by the morning of May 16th, with the front stalling out over the region until clearing to the east by the morning hours of May 17th. Ahead of the cold front, a typically unstable late spring air mass was present, with temperatures in the 80s and dewpoint temperatures in the upper 60s and lower 70s. The combination of strong wind shear for mid-May and a moist, unstable environment set the stage for severe weather across central Kentucky and southern Indiana.||During the early morning hours on May 16th, discrete cells, some supercellular, began to develop along the Ohio River and across central Kentucky. These cells were assisted by a 35 knot southwesterly low-level jet, which provided enough instability via low-level moisture transport for convection to initiate. Most of the morning convection was elevated, with between 2000-3000 J/kg of most unstable parcel CAPE present above a relatively stable boundary layer. Given the strong flow aloft, effective bulk shear was strong, around 55-60 kt, supporting organized multicell and supercell clusters. For the first wave of storms which moved across central Kentucky during the morning hours, large hail was the primary severe threat, with several reports of quarter to ping pong ball sized hail reported in severe storms. By later in the morning, isolated wind damage was also observed with severe storms across south central Kentucky. The first wave of storms continued until around midday, with a lull in activity occurring through the late afternoon hours.||During the early and mid-afternoon hours, breaks in cloud cover allowed for additional destabilization to occur, with temperatures warming into the low 80s and dewpoint temperatures in the low 70s ahead of the second wave of severe storms. This would support between 3500-4500 J/kg of surface-based CAPE across central Kentucky and extending into southern Indiana, setting up quite an unstable environment. Wind shear values were also extremely high ahead of the second wave of storms, with 60-70 knots of effective bulk shear noted in mesoanalysis data. Strong low-level wind shear and helicity were also present, with the parameter space supporting significant threats from damaging winds, hail, and tornadoes. The second wave of storms began as a broken line of supercells across Missouri, which moved into western and central Kentucky during the early evening hours. A dominant lead supercell moved across south central Kentucky, producing significant wind damage and up to baseball sized hail as it tracked from Logan and Butler County across to Russell County. As the supercell moved across Russell County, rotation aloft within the cell translated to the ground, with the storm producing a strong tornado which produced up to EF3 damage in eastern Russell County before tracking for nearly 60 miles across southeastern Kentucky, with maximum damage of EF4 strength near London. Additional supercells farther to the north also produced isolated wind damage and hail. By the late evening hours, supercells across western Kentucky and southern Illinois merged into a squall line as it moved over central Kentucky, producing larger swaths of wind damage with several reports of over 60 mph winds.

For the first wave of storms which moved across central Kentucky during the morning hours, large hail was the primary severe threat, with several reports of quarter to ping pong ball sized hail reported in severe storms. By later in the morning, isolated wind damage was also observed with severe storms across south central Kentucky. The first wave of storms continued until around midday, with a lull in activity occurring through the late afternoon hours.||During the early and mid-afternoon hours, breaks in cloud cover allowed for additional destabilization to occur, with temperatures warming into the low 80s and dewpoint temperatures in the low 70s ahead of the second wave of severe storms. This would support between 3500-4500 J/kg of surface-based CAPE across central Kentucky and extending into southern Indiana, setting up quite an unstable environment. Wind shear values were also extremely high ahead of the second wave of storms, with 60-70 knots of effective bulk shear noted in mesoanalysis data. Strong low-level wind shear and helicity were also present, with the parameter space supporting significant threats from damaging winds, hail, and tornadoes. The second wave of storms began as a broken line of supercells across Missouri, which moved into western and central Kentucky during the early evening hours. A dominant lead supercell moved across south central Kentucky, producing significant wind damage and up to baseball sized hail as it tracked from Logan and Butler County across to Russell County. As the supercell moved across Russell County, rotation aloft within the cell translated to the ground, with the storm producing a strong tornado which produced up to EF3 damage in eastern Russell County before tracking for nearly 60 miles across southeastern Kentucky, with maximum damage of EF4 strength near London. Additional supercells farther to the north also produced isolated wind damage and hail. By the late evening hours, supercells across western Kentucky and southern Illinois merged into a squall line as it moved over central Kentucky, producing larger swaths of wind damage with several reports of over 60 mph winds. A spin-up tornado was also observed with this line over Logan County, producing EF1 damage. The line of severe storms finally pushed into eastern Kentucky during the early morning hours on May 17th, bringing an end to the severe weather threat.",40047

An unusually deep closed upper low slowly moved across the upper Midwest on the 16th, with strong mid- and upper-level southwest flow overspreading the Mississippi and Ohio Valley. The upper low pressure system brought a surface cold front into the Mississippi Valley by the morning of May 16th, with the front stalling out over the region until clearing to the east by the morning hours of May 17th. Ahead of the cold front, a typically unstable late spring air mass was present, with temperatures in the 80s and dewpoint temperatures in the upper 60s and lower 70s. The combination of strong wind shear for mid-May and a moist, unstable environment set the stage for severe weather across central Kentucky and southern Indiana.||During the early morning hours on May 16th, discrete cells, some supercellular, began to develop along the Ohio River and across central Kentucky. These cells were assisted by a 35 knot southwesterly low-level jet, which provided enough instability via low-level moisture transport for convection to initiate.
